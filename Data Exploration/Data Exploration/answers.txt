It's much easier to use the built-in functions in R, as they are already created compared to creating my own functions. However, 


Mean is the average of a data set, median is the middle value of a data set, and range is the min and max values of a data set. 
These values are useful in data exploration prior to machine learning because they allow a reader to better understand the data.
For example: if the mean is much larger than the median, then it is likely that there are a few very large outliers skewing the data.


Covariance and correlation are connected and both help describe the relationship between two variables. 
Covariance is measuring the change in one variable vs the change in the other variable, showing the association between those changes or the lack thereof.
Correlation is covariance just scaled to [-1, 1] in order to make it easier to interpret now that they have a min and max to compare to.
This data is useful, especially in machine learning, because it gives more insight into the relationship between the two variables, helping a user
determine how well a change in one variable would predict a change in the other. Thus, it allows for better predictions of values not found in the data set.
